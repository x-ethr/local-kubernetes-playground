                                      THIS IS A BETA FIELD. It is on by default but can be opted out
                                      through a Crossplane feature flag.
                                      ManagementPolicies specify the array of actions Crossplane is allowed to
                                      take on the managed and external resources.
                                      This field is planned to replace the DeletionPolicy field in a future
                                      release. Currently, both could be set independently and non-default
                                      values would be honored if the feature flag is enabled. If both are
                                      custom, the DeletionPolicy field will be ignored.
