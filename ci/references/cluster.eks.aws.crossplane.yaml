                                      through a Crossplane feature flag.
                                      ManagementPolicies specify the array of actions Crossplane is allowed to
                                      take on the managed and external resources.
                                      This field is planned to replace the DeletionPolicy field in a future
                                      release. Currently, both could be set independently and non-default
                                      values would be honored if the feature flag is enabled. If both are
                                      custom, the DeletionPolicy field will be ignored.

                            Kubernetes assigns addresses from either the 10.100.0.0/16
                            or 172.20.0.0/16 CIDR blocks. We recommend that you specify
                            a block that does not overlap with resources in other
                            networks that are peered or connected to your VPC. You
                            can only specify a custom CIDR block when you create a
                            cluster, changing this value will force a new cluster
                            to be created. The block must meet the following requirements:'
